# Cross-platform Programming Labs (Java & Kotlin)

Laboratory works implemented in **Java** and **Kotlin** with structured reports (algorithms, flowcharts, and run results).

# Lab 01
Console apps, linear algorithms, input/output


## Requirements
- Two tasks (Task 1 and Task 2)
- Flowcharts
- Implementations in Java and Kotlin
- Run results included in the report

## Structure
- `java/` — Java solution
- `kotlin/` — Kotlin solution
- `report/` — report + flowcharts
